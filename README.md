# Weather App

This web application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The application uses the GeoLocator API to determine the user's location, and the [freeCodeCamp weather API](https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/).

Please allow the application to access your location. Feel free to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
